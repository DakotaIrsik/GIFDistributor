- **Peak times**: May take up to 72 hours

#### Q: What causes content to be flagged?
**A:** Low confidence in automated classification, such as:
- Ambiguous imagery

### Appeals & Reviews

#### Q: How do I appeal a rejection?
**A:** Email moderation@gifdist.io with:
1. Your scan ID or asset ID
2. Explanation of why content is SFW
3. Any relevant context

Appeals are reviewed within 2-3 business days.

#### Q: What if I disagree with a manual review?
**A:** Manual reviews by human moderators are considered final. However, you can submit additional context if you believe there was a misunderstanding.

#### Q: Can I reupload rejected content?
**A:** No. Uploading the same content that was rejected may result in account penalties. If you believe the rejection was in error, file an appeal instead.
