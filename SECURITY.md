## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Disclose Publicly

Please do not create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### 2. Report Privately

Send details to the project maintainers via:
- GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
- Private email to project maintainers

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if available)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Based on severity
  - Critical: Within 7 days
  - High: Within 30 days
  - Medium: Within 90 days
  - Low: Next release cycle

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

#### Secrets Management
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Follow the [Secrets Management Guide](docs/secrets-management.md)
- Rotate secrets every 90 days

#### Code Security
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Run security linters and scanners

#### Content Safety
- All uploaded content must pass AI safety scanning
- Enforce SFW-only policy
- Maintain audit trail for moderation actions
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

### For Deployment

#### GitHub Actions
- Use GitHub Environments for secret management
- Enable branch protection rules
- Require code review before merging
- Use self-hosted runners for sensitive workflows
- Implement secret rotation reminders

#### API Security
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate Content-Type headers
- Use signed URLs for protected content
- Set appropriate CORS policies

#### Infrastructure
- Use principle of least privilege
- Enable audit logging
- Implement monitoring and alerting
- Regular security updates
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Output encoding implemented
- [ ] Dependencies regularly updated
- [ ] Security linters configured

### Deployment
- [ ] Secrets stored in secure vault (GitHub Secrets/Environments)
- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Monitoring and logging enabled
- [ ] Regular backups configured

### Operations
- [ ] Secrets rotated every 90 days
- [ ] Security patches applied promptly

- [ ] Team trained on security procedures

## Known Security Considerations

### AI Safety Scanning
- OpenAI API keys must be properly secured
- Keys should be rotated every 90 days
- Separate keys for production and development
- Monitor API usage for anomalies

### Content Moderation
- Automated scanning may have false positives/negatives
- Manual review available for edge cases
- All moderation actions logged for audit
- User appeals process documented

### Rate Limiting
- Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- Multiple strategies available (token bucket, sliding window)
- Per-IP and per-user limits
- Configurable thresholds

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- CCPA compliance for California users
- Data retention policies documented
- User data deletion process

### Content Policy
- SFW-only enforcement
- DMCA takedown process
- Terms of Service and AUP
- Privacy Policy

## Security Tools

### Automated Scanning
- GitHub Dependabot (dependency vulnerabilities)
- GitHub Code Scanning (CodeQL)
- Secret scanning (prevent commits)
- Automated rotation reminders

### Manual Review
- Security code reviews
- Penetration testing (planned)
- Third-party security audits (planned)

## Contact

For security concerns or questions:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Project maintainers (see CODEOWNERS)

## Updates

This security policy is reviewed and updated quarterly.
