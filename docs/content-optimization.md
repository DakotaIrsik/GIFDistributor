# Content Optimization Guide

## Overview

This guide helps you create GIFs that propagate quickly, rank well in search, and engage audiences across all platforms.

## Universal Best Practices

### Technical Optimization

**Resolution:**
```
Minimum:  480x480px (mobile-friendly)
Optimal:  720x720px or 1280x720px (HD)
Maximum:  1920x1080px (rarely needed for GIFs)
```

**File Size:**
```
Target by platform:
  GIPHY:   < 8MB (5MB ideal)
  Tenor:   < 5MB (3MB ideal)
  Discord: < 8MB free, < 50MB Nitro
  Slack:   < 5MB
  Teams:   < 5MB
```

**Duration:**
```
Optimal: 2-4 seconds
  - Short enough to loop naturally
  - Long enough to convey message
  - Keeps file size manageable

Acceptable: 1-10 seconds
  - Platform-specific requirements
  - Context-dependent
```

**Frame Rate:**
```
Standard: 15-20 FPS
  - Smooth motion
  - Reasonable file size
  - Good compatibility

High-quality: 24-30 FPS
  - Smoother animation
  - Larger file size
  - Use selectively
```

### Visual Quality

**Composition:**
- Clear focal point
- Minimal distractions
- Centered action
- Good contrast

**Color:**
- Vibrant but not oversaturated
- Limited palette (reduces file size)
- Good contrast for visibility
- Test on light/dark backgrounds

**Looping:**
- Seamless loops (start = end)
- Natural repetition
- No jarring transitions
- Smooth motion flow

### Format Selection

**GIF vs. MP4:**

| Format | Best For | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|----------|------------|---------------|
| **GIF** | Simple animations, compatibility | Universal support, auto-play | Large files, limited colors |
| **MP4** | Complex videos, file size | Better compression, higher quality | Some platforms convert to GIF |

**GIFDistributor recommendation:**
- Upload source video (MP4/MOV)
- Let platform auto-convert per destination
- Maintains quality + optimal format per platform

## Metadata Strategy

### Title Best Practices

✅ "Monday Morning Coffee Need"
```

**Bad titles:**
```

❌ "😂😂😂 SO FUNNY 😂😂😂"
```

**Guidelines:**
- Descriptive (what's happening)
- Natural language (how people search)
- Concise (under 60 characters)
- Specific (not generic)
- No ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation

### Tag Strategy

**Tag types to include:**

**1. Subject/Object (What)**
```
Examples: dog, cat, coffee, computer, car
```

**2. Action (What's happening)**
```
Examples: dancing, laughing, typing, running, eating
```

**3. Emotion/Reaction (Feeling)**
```
Examples: happy, frustrated, excited, confused, relieved
```

**4. Context (When/Why to use)**
```
Examples: birthday, monday, celebration, awkward, deadline
```

**5. Search queries (How people search)**
```
Examples: "yes!", "come on", "omg", "are you serious", "let's go"
```

**Tag quality over quantity:**
```
Good (10 high-value tags):
happy, celebration, excited, dance, party, good news, success, achievement, pumped, let's go

Bad (20 low-value tags):
happy, happiness, joy, joyful, joyous, pleased, cheerful, delighted, glad, elated, ecstatic, thrilled, excited, enthusiasm, enthusiastic, upbeat, positive, good, great, amazing
```

### Description Writing

**Effective descriptions:**
- 1-2 sentences
- Natural language
- Includes main tags organically
- Searchable phrases

**Example:**
```
Title: "Excited Yes Celebration"
Description: "Person jumping up and celebrating with excited fist pump after receiving good news"
Tags: yes, celebration, excited, good news, fist pump, happy, success, achievement
```
