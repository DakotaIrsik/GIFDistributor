## Content Moderation Process

### Automated Scanning

All uploaded content undergoes automated scanning:

1. **Metadata Analysis**: Titles, tags, and descriptions are scanned for policy violations
2. **Visual Content Analysis**: AI-powered scanning detects inappropriate imagery
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Each scan produces a confidence score (0-100%)

### Moderation Decisions

Based on scan results, content receives one of three decisions:

- **✅ Approved** (High confidence - safe): Content is immediately available
- **❌ Rejected** (High confidence - violation): Content is blocked and not published
- **⚠️ Flagged** (Low confidence - uncertain): Content is queued for manual human review

### Manual Review

Content flagged as uncertain is reviewed by human moderators who:
- Examine the full context of the content
- Apply policy guidelines consistently
- Make final approval or rejection decisions
- Document their reasoning for compliance and appeals

### Review Thresholds

- **Auto-approve threshold**: 95% confidence (configurable)
- **Auto-reject threshold**: 80% confidence (configurable)
- **Strict mode**: Available for enhanced filtering
